## Contact Manager

This is a Python-based contact management application that allows users to store, manage, and organize their contacts. The application supports adding, viewing, editing, and deleting contacts and stores contact information in a file for persistence.

Features
Add Contact: Add a new contact by entering a name, phone number, and email address.

View Contacts: Display all saved contacts.

Edit Contact: Update the phone number or email of an existing contact.

Delete Contact: Remove a contact from the contact list.

Persistent Storage: Contacts are stored in a file (contacts.txt) so they remain available even after the program is closed.
